# JS Weather App

## Description

JS Weather App lets you to know current weather data on a location provided. If you allow the geo location permission, it took your data to find the place you are.

This is a little project, which is a part of my study path. It's made with a simple skills of HTML for the markup, plain CSS for style, and vanilla JavaScript for the functionality.
The weather data is collect through the [OpenWeather API.](https://openweathermap.org/)
